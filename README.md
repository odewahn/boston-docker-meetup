# Docker Global Hackday

Join other Boston-area developers and Docker fans for Docker Global Hack Day #2. We'll livestream the 1.3 announcement  and have plenty of food, coffee, and wifi for this hack day. The fun continues with a Docker Meetup with plenty of interesting talks and demos, as well as judging of the winning hack. All hacks will be submitted for consideration to win conference and plane tickets to DockerCon Europe in Amsterdam!

## Confirmed Lightning Talks

After lunch and the livestream, we have the following confirmed talks:

* [Andrei Mackenzie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreimackenzie) from clypd(http://clypd.com/) on how clypd uses Docker to streamline their testing process.
* [Elias Torres](http://www.eliastorres.com/) from [Hubspot](http://www.hubspot.com/).  A short talk and demo about [Singularity](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity), a Mesos scheduler (HTTP API and webapp) for running mesos tasksâ€”long running processes, one-off tasks, and scheduled jobs.  This was a dry-run for his presentation next week at AWS re:Invent.
* [Paul Lam](https://twitter.com/quantisan) from [Spokepoint](http://www.spokepoint.com/).  Paul presented on [Fig for Developing Microservices](http://www.slideshare.net/quantisan/2014-docker-boston-fig-for-developing-microservices). Fig is a big part of the new Docker release, and Paul's presentation makes a compelling case about how to streamline your architecture and workflows.
