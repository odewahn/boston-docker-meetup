As a followup from his presentation at our January meeting, Jonas Rosland and the great folks at [EMC Code](http://emccode.github.io/) are hosting a day-long training session on Docker fundamentals.  The event is intended for Docker beginners, so if you're wondering which orchestration tool you should implement or worried about the PID 1 zombie reaping problem, then this is NOT the day for you.  The event is being held at EMC's new community space in Kendall Square.

Because this is a training event, attendance is capped to 30 people to ensure that everyone gets personalized attention.  So, if you're new to Docker and looking for a great introduction, this will is a great opportunity to get a hands on introduction to the fundamentals.  (And then some!)
